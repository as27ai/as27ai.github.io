# ashah661.github.io

Personal website for Aryan Shah hosted on GitHub Pages. The site features an about section and a curated blog showcase inspired by Andrew Ng's personal homepage design aesthetic.

## Local development

Because the site is static HTML/CSS you can open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the project with any static file server (for example `python -m http.server`).
